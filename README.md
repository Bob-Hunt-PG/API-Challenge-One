API Challenge
Due Thursday by 11:59pm Points 18 Submitting a text entry box

Instructions
It is time to put everything you have learned so far together. For this assignment, you will build your own dynamic client side web application.

 

First, choose from one of the APIs listed below. Then start building our your project.

Your application should utilize fetch to pull data from the selected API and then use DOM manipulation to display the data from the API.

 

This will be the first API project of two.

We mainly want to see your understanding and ability to fetch data from an API, use DOM manipulation to tie the JavaScript to HTML, and your ability to then take that data and display it to the screen. 

 

Requirements
You must provide the following:

Pull data from an API that we have provided
Utilize GET only
Be as creative as you like
Feel free to use Bootstrap, Material, Flexbox, CSS Grid, etc.
Content should be visually appealing
The content must be professional and appropriate
The selected API and display of the data should differ from the examples given in class.
Styling:
Some styling is required
Do not take up a large portion of your time styling - that's always something you can come back to.

Submission Guidelines
API is to be deployed to GitHub Pages. You will submit your GitHub pages link as well as the link to the GitHub repository for this assignment. 

 

Plagiarism
Most importantly, this project should be your code. We urge you to use your resources to learn more to achieve your desired product.

You can utilize a tutorial to further your knowledge and increase your understanding of fetching and displaying data from an API.

However, this project must contain code you wrote and understand. It cannot be code acquired from a tutorial.
